# Settlement

Settlement is a game that put you in charge of a small camp in post-apocalyptical wasteland.

You'll have to gather resources, craft what you need and construct many buildings in order to survive.
The environment is not going to be helpful, challenging you with random events.

Luckily, human strength is to learn and act fast. So keep moving and you may live a little longer.

## Goals

Here's the few rules I try to follow making this game :
 * Keep it simple (prefer depth)
 * Value player's time (don't waste it)
 * Not too bleak (simple art over no art)

Please, if you want to see a new feature, [drop me a word (or vote for one existing)](https://github.com/GMartigny/settlement/labels/feature).
I'll be more than happy to do it when I get the time.
